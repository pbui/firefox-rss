# Firefox RSS

A dumb script to generate a RSS feed for Mozilla Firefox releases, since
apparently they don't provide that themselves.

It works by scraping the [Mozilla Firefox FTP](https://ftp.mozilla.org).

You can find the generated feed here:
[yld.me/raw/firefox-rss](https://yld.me/raw/firefox-rss).

It is updated every **3** hours.
